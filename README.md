# Monopoly-Simulation v0.0.1
A mathematical simulation of the board game Monopoly to determine the probability of landing on any given space. This project was born out of a grueling loss in a game of Monopoly to somebody who only owned the railroads. I believe this is a suboptimal strategy and was unlikely to succeed, but this skepticism was met with mockery. That shall not stand!

Finished:
- Moving Simulation Complete
- DataFrame of final counts created


To Do:
- Parallelize Simulations
- Analyze probabilities
- Take command line input for number of players in a game and number of iterations
- TBD for future versions
